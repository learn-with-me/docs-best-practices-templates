|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Context Gathering** | Candidate refuses to clarify the question or their thought process, and jumps right into diagramming | Candidate fails to fully clarify the question or their thought process, leading to extensive modifications needing to be made throughout the interview | Candidate is able to ask some questions to clarify the prompt, but requires hand holding from the Interviewer to fully grasp the right approach | Candidate is able to clarify the question well, but needs to be prompted to discuss their thought process with the Interviewer before starting | Candidate is able to proactively collaborate with the Interviewer to understand the problem and walk through their thought process before starting on their solution |
| **Service Design**    | Candidate is unable to make any progress on the question | Candidate is able to complete most of the core portion of the question, but is unable to fully implement the solution | Candidate is able to complete the core portions of the question, but fails to implement/get to all portions | Candidate is able to complete all portions of the question, but fails to reach implementation of the optimal solution | Candidate is able to complete all portions of the question in an optimal manner |
| **Ambiguity**         | Candidate refuses or fails to adapt their solution to new requirements | Candidate needs some hand holding to fully understand the new requirements, and struggles to ideate on solutions without guidance from the Interviewer | Candidate needs some hand holding to fully understand the new requirements, but can discuss through their solution for tackling them | Candidate needs some hand holding to fully understand the new requirements, and can fully implement new extensions on their solution to accommodate | Candidate is able to rapidly and collaboratively work with the Interviewer to design and implement new extensions on their solution for new requirements |
| **Database**          | Candidate is unable to pick a database solution | Candidate might know one database well/one approach to their data model, but is unable to discuss alternatives or optimizations | Candidate has some knowledge on how to reason about their database/data model choices, but are unable to dive deep on pros/cons/alternatives | Candidate is able to weigh the pros and cons to their database solution/data model, with prompting from the Interviewer | Candidate proactively discusses the pros and cons to their database solution/data model |
| **Scale**             | Candidate is unable to discuss scalability of their solution | Candidate is able to talk about scaling, but either is inaccurate at points or cannot discuss why they would use a certain scaling optimization vs an alternative one | Candidate has some knowledge on how to scale their solution, but misses core components (caching, data replication, etc) | Candidate is able to discuss how they can scale their solution, with prompting from the Interviewer | Candidate proactively discusses ways they can scale their solution |
| **Security**          | Candidate is unable to discuss securing their solution | Candidate has some surface-level about how to secure their system, but cannot dive deeper with the Interviewer to discuss | Candidate is able to talk about a couple of aspects of securing their system, but have large knowledge gaps during discussions with the Interviewer | Candidate is able to comprehensively discuss how their solution can be secured, with prompting from the Interviewer | Candidate is able to proactively discuss how their solution can be secured (cookie auth on endpoints, database security, network security, etc) |
| **Consistency**       | Candidate is unable to discuss data consistency, either conceptually, or as it pertains to their solution | Candidate has some surface-level about how consistency patterns work and what their solution might fit, but cannot dive deeper with the Interviewer to discuss | Candidate is able to provide some basic trade-off discussions around their solutions consistency patterns, but has some foundational knowledge gaps in the area | Candidate is able to comprehensively explain the tradeoffs and their reasoning for the consistency pattern theyâ€™ve established in their solution, with prompting from the interviewer | Candidate is able to proactively speak on the consistency of their design, and is able to reason through why their consistency model fits the intended solution |
