# Interviewing Candidates

There is no one way to do it, no best way to do it. Everyone has a different approach, however having a template surely helps.

## Prerequisite

Always have the following checklist prepared before the interview:

- [ ] Candidate's resume
- [ ] Position/Role they are applying for
- [ ] Job description
- [ ] Question(s) you're going to ask
  - [ ] Backup question - in case the candidate has seen that question in past or the given question is solved too soon
- [ ] Rubric they'll be evaluated against

## Tips

1. Make sure you look at the prerequisites
2. Keep a copy of the interview template in an new editable document for you to take notes during an interview
3. Block 15 mins of time just before the interview start to have everything set up
4. Block 15 mins to time right after the interview for writing feedback, while everything is still fresh in your mind.
